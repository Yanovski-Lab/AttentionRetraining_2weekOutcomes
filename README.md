## Overview
```
This project hosts the data analysis scripts for the preliminary outcome data from a 2-week-long smartphone delivered attention retraining program. 
Clinical Trials Identifier: NCT02977403

Data were processed in bids format following the mne_bids_pipeline.
We used custom code to extract oscillatory power for prespecified ROIs (see separated_mixed_source_estimates.py).
Data and code developed for hypothesis testing are stored in the hypothesis_testing folder.
Data labels are explained in the "Variable Dictionary" document.
